# QCF quantum computing functions for Matlab

This fork includes more algorithms and more memory efficient functions. The Shor, Simon, and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms have been added. The Simon, Simon-Jozsa, and Grover algorithms have been updated to solve problems of variable sizes. The memory usage of the quantum functions have been improved by using sparse matrices and vectorization to solve larger sized problems. As last, the help descriptions of the matlab functions have been improved. Run quantum algorithm examples using the matlab scripts test_algoritm_name.m.
